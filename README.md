# hangman-game-app

This iOS app is a classic hangman game where players have to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. 

App narrative ~~~~

1) The game begins with a secret word that the player has to guess. 
2) The player can suggest a letter by tapping on the corresponding button on the screen.
3) If the suggested letter is present in the secret word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4) If the suggested letter is not present in the secret word, a part of the hangman reduce your number of guess.
5) The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the secret word. If the hangman is fully drawn before the player can guess the word, the game is over.
